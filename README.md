Adverse Drug Reaction Extraction from Drug Labels

### Updated Plans:
1. Use ngram to train a baseline model, such as Naive Baysian Classifier or Logistic Regression
2. Start with simple CNN (Jeremy's) or LSTM (Yannet's); be sure to train the word vector instead of using a pre-trained model
3. Maybe downsampling or upsampling
